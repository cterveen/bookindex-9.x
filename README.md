# bookindex-9.x

A port of the Drupal anchor-7.x module to Drupal 9.x.

This module will add an index to a book or bookpage. Items can be added to the index by adding an anchor in the book page with the name index\[Keyword]. The index is shown for the book page and subpages on the url /book/index/\[node].

The current version is something that 'works' and mainly archived for my myself. It's not up to the Drupal standards (or any other standards) and has a lot of ugly code. Use it at your own risk, please do not upload to arctic vaults.
