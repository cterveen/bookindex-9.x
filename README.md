## Project title

bookindex-9.x

## Description

bookindex-9.x is a Drupal 9 module that adds index functionality to Drupal books. Although search functions can be useful to find certain items an index will lead to the correct description instantly. The index is also exported to a printable version by bookexport-rtf.

The code has been ported to Drupal 9.x but is not up to standards and should be considered a alpha version. No help page or options are available. Internationalisation and localisation is not available. The module is not in the Drupal module repository.

The project is currently not in use but worked in a test environment. Further development is intended.

## Installation

Copy all the files into /modules/bookindex

Enable the module

## Use

The index is shown for the book page and subpages on the url /book/index/\[node].
