## Project title

bookindex-9.x

## Description

bookindex-9.x is a Drupal 9 module that adds index functionality to Drupal books. Although search functions can be useful to find certain items an index will lead to the correct description instantly. The index is also exported to a printable version by bookexport-rtf.

The project should be considered a alpha version. The project is currently not in use but worked in a test environment. The code is not up to standard. No help page or options are available. Internationalisation and localisation is not available. The module is not in the Drupal module repository.

Further development is intended.
